## What is PERMA-DATA ?

**PERMA-DATA** is being developped to agregate [**plant data**] from various but consistent sources.

Our main concern is to make data available for everybody, while ensuring its quality and maintainability.

**PERMA-DATA** manifest can be found below, sumed up as a list of principles.

### Principles

#### #1. Gather and abstract plant data
Extract [**plant data**] from different supports, and then, break it in an atomic and interoperable format.

#### #2. Shapes plant data for user
From this raw and numerous atomic [**plant data**] (*principle 1*), build a user-friendly interface to display consistent data views.

#### #3. Eco-responsible infrastructure
Development and hosting aims for the lowest energetic and financial costs.

#### #4. Minimalist features and workflows
To enforces its low consumption orientation (*principle 3*) and save user time and attention, application remains as simple as possible.

#### #5. Playing is learning
As part of shaping data (*principle 6*), a gamification layer has been added to make and the learning more playful and the data crawling more interesting.

#### #6. A fantastic universe
The story of the **PERMA-DATA** game (*principle 5*) takes place between a near future and up to the end of universe : an ideal setup for imaginating tomorrow's solutions.

#### #7. Art for the soul
Illustrating this very universe (*principle 6*), creativity and aesthetics are also a support for sharing knowledge better.

#### #8. A philosophical tale
Universe (*principle 6*) and art (*principle 7*) seres as an image/metaphor of way more abstract concepts.

#### #9. Research tool
Sourced and verfied [**plant data**], that you can contribute to enlarge by your work (*principle 10*).

#### #9. Gardening tool
Inventory your genetics, manage plants growing in your garden, get tips and send feedback (*principle 9*).

#### #11. Community tool
Gardening (*principle **) is also sharing. We are giving an pleasant interface to chat and visualize tasks.

#### #12. Collaborative development
The application is open-source, ready for user and developer interactions.

#### #13. Implementation of shared patterns
Patterns are defined not to obfuscate architecture but to define a common language, easing design exchanges and code refactoring.

#### #14. Continous improvement
The application will never stop improving in term of reliability and features.

## Development
**PERMA-DATA** is built on a composite stack :

* **Server :** `node` + `express`

  * `pugjs` template engine
  * `mongo` database
  
* **Client :** `jquery` + `react` [**bundles**]

  * `redux` state management

The design promotes use of code **patterns** to enforce a scallable architecture. Please refer to [the dedicated section](#patterns) of this document to learn more.

### Quick start
*Partially deprecated, to review.*

#### Installation
* First of all, install dependencies with `npm install`.

Before starting, you'll have to set :
* The MongoDB "secret" file, containing connection username & password.

#### Set up db.secret.json
1. In the `./src/db` folder, create a `db.secret.json` file.
2. Inside of it, add the following entries :

```json
{
  "username": "<userame>",
  "password": "<password>
}
```

3. Go on the MongoDB Atlas instance, in the *Database Access* tab.
4. Choose or create an user, and copy-paste its credentials in the json file.

#### Local server
* Start the server with `npm start`
* For the purpose of specific server development, use the nodemon-mounted application by running `npm run dev-start`

*No server features actually depend on the NODE_ENV variables, while it may change in the future.*

#### Other scripts
* `npm test` runs the Mocha/Cha√Ø **unit testing** suite.
The script excludes all "#e2e"-tagged tests.

### Patterns

#### \_middlewares
`_middlewares` is located in the `server/app` folder.

This pattern only describes the *middleware* nature of its contained folders and files.

#### \_routes
`_routes` is located in the `server/app` folder.

This pattern describes the `server`'s routes-tree architecture.
