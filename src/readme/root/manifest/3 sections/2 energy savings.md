* Reduction of development time, code complexity, technical debt (standards, technology intelligence, documentation, refactorables).
* Reduction of provider's features (cf. [stack](#developers--stack-and-features)) *financial cost* (progressive implementation).
* **Minimalist features and workflow**.
* Reduction of users' time spent and interaction needed to fulfill tasks on the application (automation).
